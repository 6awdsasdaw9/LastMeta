Dear Lola,

Today is your birthday, and we want to congratulate you on this special day! Every day we think of you and miss you, but unfortunately, due to work, we can't be with you as often as we'd like.

We know that sometimes it can be hard for you without us, but remember that you're always in our thoughts and hearts. We're very proud of your courage and resilience, and we're confident that you can handle all the challenges that come your way.

As a present, we're sending you a real space helmet "Olympus" because we know how much you love games and adventures! We hope this helmet will be your loyal companion on all your exciting expeditions and bring even more fun and happiness to your life. Let it remind you that we're always with you, even if we're far away.

We love you and will always support you in everything you do! Happy Birthday, dear Lola!

Best wishes, Your parents.
