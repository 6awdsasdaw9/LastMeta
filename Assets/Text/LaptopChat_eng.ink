today
Panta Rhei: Hey bro, it's your birthday today! I know we haven't spoken in a while, and I'm really sorry for how I messed up. I want to turn a new page in our relationship and do whatever it takes to make things right between us.

Panta Rhei: I know my actions were silly and wrong, and it will take time to regain trust and rebuild our bond. But I want to take the first step and reach out to you to express how sorry I am.

Panta Rhei: If you don't want to talk to me, that's okay, but there's a cake I got for you. If you want to grab it and hang out somewhere to chat and settle our issues, I'm totally up for it.

Panta Rhei: I hope your birthday is going great, and that you're receiving all the love, support, and attention you deserve. Once again, happy birthday, bro!
